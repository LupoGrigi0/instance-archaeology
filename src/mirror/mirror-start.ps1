.SYNOPSIS
  Windows port of claude-session-mirror's bin/mirror-start.sh.

.DESCRIPTION
  A port of Cairn-2001's launcher. The SERVER needed two fixes (both now upstream
  in 304fd51); this launcher is the actual port, because bin/mirror-start.sh is
  325 lines of bash.

  Verified on lupos-lap, Windows 11, node v24.11.1, Claude Code 2.1.251:
    - os.homedir() resolves correctly; dataDir lands in C:\Users\<u>\.claude-mirror
    - .hacs-identity parses through a UTF-8 BOM (utf-8-sig)
    - every src/*.mjs parses under node v24
    - the slug algorithm is already platform-correct (see below)
    - CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID *is* exported to children on Windows

  NOT RUN. Written, not started -- standing up a server is persistent machine
  state and Lupo was away. Someone must review before this first launches.

.NOTES
  DEFAULTS TO READ-ONLY WITH NO GRANTS, per Cairn's instruction: confirm the
  transcript tail and SSE stream work on Windows before any write path exists.
  If the read half is broken you want to know that without a browser also being
  able to type into your session.
